Universal standards that apply to all code, regardless of language, framework, or target platform.

## File Naming Convention

Standard files use kebab-case: `security.md`, `architecture.md`, `root-cause-analysis.md`, etc.

Each file follows the format spec defined in [`standards/README.md`](../README.md).
