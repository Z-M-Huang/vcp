# Web Frontend Standards

Standards specific to client-side web development (browser-based applications).

These build on the [core standards](../core/README.md) with frontend-specific guidance.

## Planned Standards

| Standard | Description | Issue | Status |
|----------|-------------|-------|--------|
| [Structure](structure.md) | Component organization, state management, folder conventions | [#4](https://github.com/Z-M-Huang/vcp/issues/4) | Draft |
| Security | XSS prevention, auth token handling, CSP, CORS | [#6](https://github.com/Z-M-Huang/vcp/issues/6) | Planned |
| Performance | Bundle discipline, lazy loading, rendering optimization | [#8](https://github.com/Z-M-Huang/vcp/issues/8) | Planned |

## File Naming Convention

Standard files use kebab-case: `structure.md`, `security.md`, `performance.md`.

Each file follows the format spec defined in [`standards/README.md`](../README.md).
